# ClassificationModel-Cellphone
Telecommunications companies providing cell phone service are interested in customer retention, particularly in identifying customers who are about to churn (cancel their service). They represent a potential worth of millions of dollars. If the company does not proactively address the customers' issues, those customers might leave the company, which would lead to a financial loss for the firm. The “Cell phone usage data” can be used to classify a customer as a churner or not. Use Churn as the output variable and all the other variables as input variables and apply all available models in the attached notebook.

Following on from the initial exploration of use cases, technical management is now advising you to develop a proof-of-concept for the application of machine learning models. For this, you are provided with a real-world dataset for the assessment. By using the course analytical software, you should
analyse the data through your own analysis plan, compare the different ML techniques, and propose context-based recommendations. Also, you should respond to some questions using the output of the designed and executed analytical models. It requires you to understand and apply the techniques and skills covered in the subject. As deliverable technical management is expecting a complete notebook outlining your model results and a report to describe and justify your results.
